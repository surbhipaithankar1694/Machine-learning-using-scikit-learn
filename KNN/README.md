In this project, data with anonymized columns has been used. KNN has been implemented for solving this categorization problem. 
Cross-validation has been performed for splitting the training file into train & test data.
In order to find the best value for K, elbow method has been implemented. This involves running the KNN algortihm for various K values and finding the optimium value of K by plotting error_rate vs K graph.
