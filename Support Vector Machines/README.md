We analyzed the famous Iris flower data set using seaborn library and latere performed classification.

The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by Sir Ronald Fisher in the 1936 as an example of discriminant analysis.
  
  
The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor), so 150 total samples. Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.

Results:  
We observe that the SVM model gives pretty good results around 98%. We misclassified one training example that was too noisy. This hints us that our model is not overfitting the data. We also performed SKlearn's grid method for illustrating the method of finding the best parameters for a given model.
